The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition. The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 2 multivalued discrete and 4 continuous variables. 

Dataset: cars-dataset.csvView in a new window

Attribute Information:

Car Name – Name of the car

Cyl – No of cylinders in the car – Multivalued discrete

Disp – Displacement – continuous

Hp – Horsepower – continuous

Wt – Weight – continuous

Acc – Accleration – continuous

Yr – Model of the car – Multivalued discrete

Steps to follow:

EDA & Pre-processing (Make sure to remove all non-numeric entries from numeric columns)
Use pair plot or scatter matrix to visualize how the different variables are related (Hint: The amount of Gaussian curves in the plot should give a visual identification of different clusters existing in the dataset)
Use K Means or Hierarchical clustering to find out the optimal no of clusters in the data. Identify and separate the clusters
