About Data –

In 2013, students of the Statistics class at FSEV UK were asked to invite their friends to participate in this survey.

The data file (responses.csv) consists of 1010 rows and 150 columns (139 integers and 11 categorical).

For convenience, the original variable names were shortened in the data file.

The data contain missing values.
The survey was presented to participants in both electronic and written form.
The original questionnaire was in Slovak language and was later translated into English.
All participants were of Slovakian nationality, aged between 15-30.
For this Project we are considering 2 sections of data –  Health Habits and Spending Habits

Health Habits - I live a very healthy lifestyle. Here Strongly disagree 1-2-3-4-5 Strongly agree
Spending Habits - I save all the money I can.: Strongly disagree 1-2-3-4-5 Strongly agree

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Agenda is to find whether Spending Habits and Healthy Lifestyle is related to Gender and Place or not.

Steps –

Load the data and extract the relevant columns.
Hint – Relevant Columns will be Finances, Gender, Village-Town and Healthy Eating.

Explore the data and understand how the data is distributed? Is there any outlier or missing value? And Share your insights.

Create Hypothesis on the following questions –
	Is saving money (finances) gender dependant?
	Is there any differences in money saving (finances) between people from city or village?
	Do Women have a Healthier Lifestyle than Men?
	Are Village People Healthier than City People?

Perform the required statistical tests to validate/reject the Hypothesis in above step.
State your insights and conclusions.
